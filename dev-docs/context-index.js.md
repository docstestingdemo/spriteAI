# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function in this code snippet is an asynchronous function designed to remove a specified background color from an image. Here's a concise explanation of its purpose and functionality:

1. It takes an input image file, processes it, and saves the result to an output file.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.

3. It scans through each pixel of the image, comparing its color to a target color (specified as a parameter).

4. If a pixel's color is close enough to the target color (within a specified threshold), it makes that pixel transparent.

5. The color comparison is done using the Jimp.colorDiff method, which calculates the difference between two colors.

6. The function allows for some flexibility in color matching through the colorThreshold parameter, which determines how close a color needs to be to the target to be considered a match.

7. After processing, it saves the modified image with the background color removed (replaced with transparency) to the specified output path.

In essence, this function automates the process of removing a specific background color from an image, which can be useful for tasks like creating transparent PNGs or isolating subjects in photos.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and manipulation.
