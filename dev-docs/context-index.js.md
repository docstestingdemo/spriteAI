# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function in this code snippet is an asynchronous function designed to remove a specific background color from an image. Here's a concise explanation of its purpose and functionality:

1. It takes an input image file, processes it, and saves the result to an output file.
2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.
3. It scans through each pixel of the image, comparing its color to a target color (specified as an input parameter).
4. If a pixel's color is close enough to the target color (within a specified threshold), it makes that pixel transparent.
5. The color comparison is done using Jimp's color difference calculation.
6. After processing all pixels, it saves the modified image with transparent areas where the background color was removed.

In essence, this function automates the process of removing a specific background color from an image, which is useful for tasks like creating cutouts or preparing images for overlays in graphic design or web development.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses a third-party library called Jimp for image processing and manipulation.
