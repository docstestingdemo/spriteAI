# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous function designed to remove a specific background color from an image. Here's a concise explanation of its purpose and functionality:

1. It takes an input image file path, output file path, target color to remove, and optional parameters like color threshold and additional options.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and process the image.

3. It scans through each pixel of the image, comparing the pixel's color to the specified target color.

4. If a pixel's color is close enough to the target color (within the specified threshold), it sets that pixel's alpha value to 0, making it transparent.

5. This effectively removes the background of the specified color, creating a new image with a transparent background where the target color was present.

6. The resulting image is then saved to the specified output path.

In essence, this function automates the process of removing a specific background color from an image, which can be useful for tasks like creating PNG images with transparent backgrounds or removing unwanted color backgrounds from photos.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses a third-party library called Jimp for image processing and manipulation.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `removeBackgroundColor` function:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const removeBackgroundColor = require('./path/to/removeBackgroundColor'); // Import the function

async function main() {
  const inputPath = path.join(__dirname, 'input-image.jpg');
  const outputPath = path.join(__dirname, 'output-image.png');
  const targetColor = '#FFFFFF'; // White background
  const colorThreshold = 50; // Adjust this value as needed

  try {
    await removeBackgroundColor(inputPath, outputPath, targetColor, colorThreshold);
    console.log('Background removed successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error removing background:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

In this example:

1. We import the `removeBackgroundColor` function (assuming it's in a separate file).
2. We define the input and output file paths.
3. We specify the target color to remove (white in this case) and a color threshold.
4. We call the `removeBackgroundColor` function with these parameters inside an async function.
5. We handle the result with a try-catch block for error handling.

Make sure to:
- Install the required dependencies (like `jimp`) if you haven't already.
- Adjust the file paths and import statement according to your project structure.
- Modify the `targetColor` and `colorThreshold` as needed for your specific image.

This code will remove the white background from the input image and save the result to the output path with a transparent background.
